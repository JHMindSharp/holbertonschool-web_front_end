## Overview

This project aims to deepen the understanding of HTML and its application in structuring web pages. Through a series of tasks, it covers the basics of HTML5, semantic HTML, navigation, multimedia integration, and more, without the use of CSS for styling. The project is structured incrementally to build a comprehensive understanding from basic to more advanced HTML concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the key guidelines for writing semantic HTML.
- Create the skeleton of an HTML5 page.
- Understand and apply semantic HTML tags to structure web content appropriately.
- Differentiate between and use `div` and `span` tags according to their use cases.
- Implement navigation within a webpage using `nav` and anchor tags.
- Embed multimedia elements like images, videos, and audio in a webpage.
- Integrate external content into a webpage using iframes.
- Structure data using tables.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several tasks, each building upon the knowledge gained in the previous ones. Below is a brief overview of some key tasks:

1. **Basic Page Setup**: Starting with a simple HTML page setup including doctype, language, and character encoding.

2. **Page Structuring**: Introduction to the head and body sections, and basic metadata like charset, viewport, title, and description.

3. **Semantic Layout**: Using semantic tags like `header`, `main`, `footer`, `aside`, `section`, and `article` to structure the page content.

4. **Navigation and Headings**: Implementing a navigation bar and using heading tags to define content hierarchy.

5. **Multimedia and Embedding**: Embedding images, videos, audio, and external content such as social media icons and Google Maps.

6. **Form Creation**: Although not styled, basic forms can be introduced to understand input types and data collection.
